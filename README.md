<h4 align="center">A very customizable and easy to use music bot, written with love in TypeScript by aesthetical#2545.</h4>

Hello! Welcome to our page! I'm sure you're wondering, "Oh, another music bot. Why would I want to use Stereo, when I could just use Rythm or Groovy?" Well, you've come to the right place! Allow us to explain...
  
Stereo has many compelling features, such as Radio Commands, Customizable Behavior such as DJ Roles, multiple prefixes and voice channel lock, and of course our extensive music category.  It will always be **free**! The only thing you may not like, is that the code is closed source! You may however, view [v1's source code](https://github.com/Stereo-Developers/stereo-deprecated).

Still not convinced that we can be better? Well that's a good thing, we haven't even talked about our features yet!
  
- **Music Commands**:
  - The classics: play, pause, resume, remove, queue, skip, etc... 
  - The more rare: nightcore, slowed, bassboost and more.
- **Spotify Support**: *disclaimer: We use Spotify URLs to fetch songs from youtube, we can't actually stream Spotify Music.*
- **Customizable Behavior**: *Configuration Commands (DJ role, announce next track, etc)*

Now you may be convinced, but are you worried about our reliability and whether you should trust Stereo?

> Stereo has been worked on for countless long hours, trying to make Stereo ultra user-friendly and bug free *which we have done*. Stereo requires little to no permissions, we only want to read and send messages, connect and play music in your voice channels.

**Permission Explaination**

Ever wondered why we needed all of these permissions? We'll explain right here:

- Read and Send Messages - To read commands and send the output. (required)
- Manage Messages - To delete responses from the user such as for song selection (optional)
- View Channel, Connect, Speak, Use Voice Activity - Voice channel permissions (required)
