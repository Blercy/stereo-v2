<h2 align="center">Data Collection</h2>

We collect data that the user gives us. An example of this could be if they set a prefix, their guild ID will be saved for customization purposes. Here we classify `If provided` a information the user provides the bot. The data we save follows:

- Guild ID's - If provided
- Voice State/Server Update's
- Channel ID's - If provided
- Role ID's - If provided

We also cache guilds and users, for statistic purposes.

<h2 align="center">Third Party Applications</h2>

We do not give any of the users information to third party applications. We save data in a local database, which is only accessiable on via Stereo, therefore there is no way to get access to our database. We save data in a USA (United States of America) server in Dallas, Texas.
